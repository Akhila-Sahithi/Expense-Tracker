# Expense-Tracker-Project
The project “Expense Tracker” is developed to manage the daily expenses in a more efficient and manageable way. By using this project we can reduce the
manual calculations of the daily expenses and keep track of the expenditure. In this project, the user can provide their monthly target to calculate their total
expenses per month and these results will be stored for the user. The project will be able to give the user an idea of their spending habits and a graph will
be shown to get a more clearer idea of their spends.
